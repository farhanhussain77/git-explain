                <p>
                    What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records 
                    changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
                    Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything 
                    from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

                    <h3>git init:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The git init command creates a new Git repository. Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in 
                        the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Open git CLI and move to the directory where you want to create new repository and run the following
                        command. This makes the git repository having name of <strong>'test'</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>git branch:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you 
                        switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git 
                        branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        following command will create a branch with the name of <strong>dev</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>git checkout:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. 
                        Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in 
                        that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following command will switch the branch from <strong>main</strong> to <strong>dev</strong>

                    <h3>git add:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells 
                        Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, 
                        git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually 
                        recorded until you run git commit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To add changes, go to your git repository and run the following command
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>git commit:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.Using the 
                        "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository.
                        <strong>-m</strong> Sets the commit's message. Make sure to provide a concise description that helps your teammates (and yourself) understand what happened.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In your git repository, run the <strong>git commit -m {message}</strong> command.
                    </p>

                    <h3>git push:</h3>
                    <p>
                        git push is most commonly used to publish an upload local changes to a central repository. 
                        After a local repository has been modified a push is executed to share the modifications 
                        with remote team members.
