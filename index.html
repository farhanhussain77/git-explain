                <p>
                    What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records 
                    changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
                    Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything 
                    from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

                        The git init command creates a new Git repository. Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in 
                        the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Open git CLI and move to the directory where you want to create new repository and run the following
                        command. This makes the git repository having name of <strong>'test'</strong>.
